            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the most significant technologies in recent years because of
            possessing the diverse application domains. The variety of applications results in a large amount of users’
            private information diffusion that will pose a paramount security concern. User authentication is a
            significant factor in the IoT environment as it allows the user to communicate with the device securely.
            Integration of authentication technologies with IoT ensures secure data retrieval and robust access control.
            This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of various authentication mechanisms for
            IoT security proposed in the literature. With the comparison of existing authentication mechanisms that are
            developed for the IoT in terms of security via a multicriteria classification, the open issues that require
            further research are identified.

                        Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm where everyday objects are interconnected and communicate
                with each other over the Internet [1]. IoT facilitates a direct integration of physical objects with the
                cyber world through smart sensors, RFID tags, smartphones, and wearable devices [2]. IoT networks offer
                various application domains encompassing environmental monitoring, healthcare, smart cities, military
                affairs, and intelligent transportation system [3, 4]. IoT application will improve rapidly. Cisco
                systems predict that by 2020, there will be over 50 billion connected things in the Internet consist of
                sensors, actuators, GPS devices, mobile devices, and all other smart things [5]. The security and
                privacy of these devices are the most notable challenges in IoT [6]. These devices have an insufficient
                mechanism of computing platforms, and the communications are wireless often that prone the system to
                various attacks. Furthermore, the number of devices revealed to the public network are increasing
                gradually and the devices have direct interaction with the physical world to gather data. All these make
                them a suitable target for malicious users. Hence, it is substantial to assure devices’ authenticity to
                ensure that the legal device is operating in an expected status and is not affected by malware. As IoT
                devices are built on various technologies such as power management and sensors, their security
                requirements vary from one application to another. Several security requirements, which are required to
                be considered in designing an authentication protocol in IoT perimeter, are delineated

                    Cloud can be a proper platform for storing and processing the IoT devices data. Cloud computing and IoT
                integration affect our daily life tasks impressively. Cloud-driven IoT privileges are more than a
                generic IoT architecture. Processing the real-time queries can be performed with less cost and
                alleviated processing overhead by cloud-driven IoT [18]. In network architecture, a remote object/user
                should verify itself within the IoT and cloud architecture. Hence, the authentication scheme is
                required. Table 2 summarizes the relevant schemes based on IoT-cloud architecture authentication.
